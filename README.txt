A Mars Rover Simulator
(Extend it if you like)

It's a standard Maven project that is pure Java (well, except the tests).
Run src/main/java/org/sample/rover/RoverProcess.java with Java 7
	- you can change Rover instructions right at the top of the process 

If you want me to build an artifact instead of having to mess with Maven, contact me and I will happily do so.
